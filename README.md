The Sure Tomorrow insurance company is exploring the use of machine learning to address several key tasks. The goal is to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of ML solutions across four areas:

Customer Similarity: Identify customers similar to a given individual to support targeted marketing.

Benefit Prediction (Classification): Predict whether a new customer will receive an insurance benefit, and compare model performance against a dummy baseline.

Benefit Count Prediction (Regression): Use linear regression to estimate the number of benefits a customer may receive.

Data Privacy: Implement a data masking algorithm to protect personal information while preserving model accuracy.

The project aims to demonstrate that machine learning can provide meaningful solutions while maintaining data privacy.
